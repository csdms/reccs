DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00001.001

Name: 2D wind speed and direction

Description: Two-dimensional wind speed and direction, available as two- and thirty-minute aggregations of 1 Hz observations.  Observations are made by 2-D sonic anemometer sensors located at multiple heights on the tower infrastructure and by 2-D sonic anemometer sensors located on the aquatic meteorological station.

NEON Science Team Supplier: TIS

Abstract: Wind plays an important role in atmospheric and environmental sciences. A function of differential heating of Earthâ€™s surface and subsequent pressure gradients, horizontal and vertical winds are responsible for advection of atmospheric pollutants, moisture, heat and momentum (Stull 1988). As such, horizontal and vertical winds will be measured throughout the Observatory.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

Brief Design Description: Multiple 2D anemometers are deployed at tower sites. They are located on each boom arm below the tower-top level at terrestrial sites. A single 2D anemometer is located at the top of the aquatic met station at a standard height of 3m above ground level. Two- and thirty-minute averages of horizontal wind speed and direction are calculated. Each 2D anemometer represents the point at which it is placed on the tower infrastructure.

Brief Study Area Description: 2D wind speed is measured at all NEON terrestrial and aquatic sites except for BLWA and TOMB.

Sensor(s): Gill - Wind Observer II; Extreme Weather Wind Observer

Keywords: met station, sonic anemometer, wind direction, wind speed, horizontal wind, meteorological station, tower

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:

For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505. 

   TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year.

Issue Date: 2019-08-02
Issue: Sensors streaming while boom was fully retracted
       Date Range: 2019-07-01 to 2021-04-30
       Location(s) Affected: HARV ML3(HOR.VER.000.030) and ML4 (HOR.VER.000.040)
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: Ongoing. Manual flagging is being applied.

Issue Date: 2020-11-06
Issue: An error in the computation of average wind direction causes wind direction data to be absent around the 360 to ~5 degrees range.
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: No resolution to date. Further investigation in the wind direction averaging algorithm is needed.

Issue Date: 2021-01-11
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or eliminated maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time, and extra scrutiny of data is advised.

The annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) also did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units that have been deployed for a year. While NEON is working towards implementing automated drift estimations/corrections on calibrated data products and flagging related to sensors that fall outside the policy for calibration frequency, this had not been implemented at the time of COVID impacts. 

The following sites had annual refreshes canceled in 2020 and will likely go up to two years of deployment for their sensors:

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS
------------------

Note that the final quality flag for wind direction (windDirFinalQF) in the basic download package includes a test for calm winds, under which the computed wind direction is unreliable (due to light wind speed) though the data quality may still be adequate for scientific purposes. To distinguish between data flagged for calm winds and other quality tests, please download the expanded package.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
