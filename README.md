# Python Programming in the Geosciences

This is a two-part (morning and afternoon) interactive workshop
on using the Python programming language in the geosciences
to perform data analysis and visualization.
The workshop is a part of the [RECCS][reccs] program at CU Boulder.

## Instructors

* [Mark Piper](https://instaar.colorado.edu/people/mark-piper/)


## Requirements

* Computer
* Web browser
* Internet access
* Coffee (optional, but recommended)


## Agenda

The workshop is divided into morning and afternoon sessions.

### Morning

The morning session runs from 9 am until noon,
with a break around the midpoint.
It covers more basic concepts,
but people with experience using Python
can join and help those with less experience.

*Topics:*

* Introductions
* Why Python?
* Logging in to the CSDMS JupyterHub
* Using Jupyter Notebook
* Python language basics
* Importing Python libraries
* Reading data from a csv file with *pandas*
* Plotting data with *matplotlib*
* Saving work to a PDF file
* Exercises and discussion

### Afternoon

The afternoon session runs from 1 pm until 4 pm,
with a break around the midpoint.
It covers more advanced topics.

*Topics:*

* Introductions
* Loops, conditionals, try-except block, functions
* NetCDF and xarray
* Analysis and visualization with Pangeo
* Exercises and discussion

## Resources

Python:
* [Software Carpentry][swc], especially the [Programming with Python][swc-python] lesson
* [Data Carpentry][dc]
* The official [Python tutorial][python-tutorial] is somewhat advanced, but has a lot of information
* The [TutorialsPoint Python tutorial][tp-tutorial] is also well done, and perhaps easier to follow

CU:
* [Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)][cires]
* [Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS)][csdms]
* [EarthLab][earthlab]
